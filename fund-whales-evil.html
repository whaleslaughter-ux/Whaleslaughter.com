    This keeps the lights on and the nonsense loud — the songs, the worlds, the websites, and the quiet hours where bad ideas turn into legends. Every coin helps cover production tools, hosting, AI, and the time it takes to build something strange enough to feel alive. There’s no merch, no secret perks, just art made with unholy enthusiasm and maybe too much coffee. If you’ve ever laughed, winced, or thought “they really shouldn’t,” then congratulations — you already know what you’re fueling.
