          <p>
            This page keeps the lights on behind every ridiculous thing I make — the songs, the worlds,
            the websites, and the quiet hours spent turning bad ideas into better ones.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your coins go toward production tools, hosting, AI subscriptions, and the time it takes to
            craft something strange and worth looking at. There’s no merch, no hidden perks — just the
            promise that every contribution helps keep new art alive and independent.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you’ve ever laughed, winced, or thought <em>“this shouldn’t work but it does,”</em> then
            you already understand what you’re fueling.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gold means you’re here for the long run. Silver means you liked what you saw. Either way,
            thank you for helping me build it.
